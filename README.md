Here we as Skalmex Sp. z o.o. publish our result of our work on localization of a worker in the building, You have to prepare data and use our algorithm to locate tag(worker) on a map (of a building). There are many options to configure. We gave many option because sometimes measures are not proper and algorithm has to do something with this.
